# User Experience (UX)
## User Stories
* ## As a Website Owner I want that:
1. The website provides clear and concise information about the organic farm business, the produce with prices and the farm trip information.
2. The website allows customers to contact the business for placing orders, booking farm trips or providing feedback.
3. The website provides an online platform for new and old customers to connect with Farm Organiks which in turn would increase the walk-ins.
