# User Experience (UX)
## User Stories
* ## As a User I want to be able to:
1. The program provides clear and concise information about the coffeehouse, the items, their prices.
2. Easily navigate between the different functions available in the program.
3. Access the product and order database implemented via Google Sheets through the CoffeehousePos application.
4. To create a application which can take order with minimal steps and complexities like self service kiosk operated by the customer only.
5. User can traverse through different items screens to view avaliable items with their prices.

# 1. Strategy
* The main purpose creating this application is to create a python project which will explore the basic implementation of a self serving cashless kiosk used by customer entirely.

# 2. Scope
* Easy to navigate options and functions which user will find very simple and straightforward.
* User can navigate the items and their prices with user input validated properly.
* User can retrieve his / her order depending on valid order value entered.

# 3. Structure
The flowchart of the application can be found ![here](/assets/images/readmeimages/CoffeehouseposFlowChart.jpg).


## The program is a command line program that leads the user through series of questions.
* The program starts by getting the customer name input.

   * The order sheet is populated with item price. Also item number 1 is assigned to the item selected by the customer for the same row.
   * This order sheet row is then copied to sales sheet to mark as transaction as final.
   * Then the order sheet row is cleared to be used for the next order.
   * The program then requests the 16 digit card number of the customer which is validated for integer and number of digits which is 16 in this case.
   * The program then requests the 4 digit pin of the customer which is validated for integer and number of digits which is 4 in this case.
   * After successful payment the program thanks the customer for the business and provides option to exit the program by pressing Enter.

* Tea screen provides 7 options including list of various teas and their prices.

   * This order sheet row is then copied to sales sheet to mark as transaction as final.
   * Then the order sheet row is cleared to be used for the next order.
   * The program then requests the 16 digit card number of the customer which is validated for integer and number of digits which is 16 in this case.
   * The program then requests the 4 digit pin of the customer which is validated for integer and number of digits which is 4 in this case.
