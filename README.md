# CoffeehousePOS

## Overview
### This is an interactive self service, Point of Sale solution that uses Google Sheets API.The program enables user to order coffee/tea/desserts. This also imitate a cashless experience for the user as he/she will pay by card. The Order information is stored which can be retrived by entering valid order value.
The project should run in a CLI, deployed via Heroku, using Python.

*** This is a fictional python project for educational purposes only ***

# User Experience (UX)
## User Stories
* ## As a User I want to be able to:
1. The program provides clear and concise information about the coffeehouse, the items, their prices.
2. Easily navigate between the different functions available in the program.
3. Access the product and order database implemented via Google Sheets through the CoffeehousePos application.
4. To create a application which can take order with minimal steps and complexities like self service kiosk operated by the customer only.
5. User can traverse through different items screens to view avaliable items with their prices.

# 1. Strategy
* The main purpose creating this application is to create a python project which will explore the basic implementation of a self serving cashless kiosk used by customer entirely.

# 2. Scope
* Easy to navigate options and functions which user will find very simple and straightforward.
* User can navigate the items and their prices with user input validated properly.
* User can retrieve his / her order depending on valid order value entered.

# 3. Structure
The flowchart of the application can be found ![here](/assets/images/readmeimages/CoffeehouseposFlowChart.jpg).


## The program is a command line program that leads the user through series of questions.
* The program starts by getting the customer name input.

* The program validates the entered customer name and generates an order value. This order value can be used to retrieve order details later.
* The generated order value and customer name is entered in the coffeehousePos spreadsheet under sheet name order. 

* Then the program leads to the Order screen of the program. This screen has four options.
   * First option leads to the Coffee screen.
   * Second option leads to the Tea screen.
   * Third option leads to the Desserts screen.
   * Fourth option leads to the Order search option
   * User input is validated, wrong entry brings back the user to order screen to choose right option
   
* Coffee screen provides 7 options including list of various coffees and their prices.
   * Option 1 to 6 provide user to choose between different coffee items.
   * Option 7 help user to go back to order screen just in case if user has changed mind.
   * User input is validated, wrong entry prompts user to input the correct choice.
   * If user choose option one to 6, program will show the order item selected with price. The order value is also shown.
   * The order sheet is populated with item price. Also item number 1 is assigned to the item selected by the customer for the same row.
   * This order sheet row is then copied to sales sheet to mark as transaction as final.
   * Then the order sheet row is cleared to be used for the next order.
   * The program then requests the 16 digit card number of the customer which is validated for integer and number of digits which is 16 in this case.
   * The program then requests the 4 digit pin of the customer which is validated for integer and number of digits which is 4 in this case.
   * After successful payment the program thanks the customer for the business and provides option to exit the program by pressing Enter.

* Tea screen provides 7 options including list of various teas and their prices.
   * Option 1 to 6 provide user to choose between different tea items.
   * Option 7 help user to go back to order screen just in case if user has changed mind.
   * User input is validated, wrong entry prompts user to input the correct choice.
   * If user choose option one to 6, program will show the order item selected with price. The order value is also shown.

   * This order sheet row is then copied to sales sheet to mark as transaction as final.
   * Then the order sheet row is cleared to be used for the next order.
   * The program then requests the 16 digit card number of the customer which is validated for integer and number of digits which is 16 in this case.
   * The program then requests the 4 digit pin of the customer which is validated for integer and number of digits which is 4 in this case.
   * After successful payment the program thanks the customer for the business and provides option to exit the program by pressing Enter.

* Desserts screen provides 7 options including list of various desserts and their prices.

   * This order sheet row is then copied to sales sheet to mark as transaction as final.
   * Then the order sheet row is cleared to be used for the next order.
   * The program then requests the 16 digit card number of the customer which is validated for integer and number of digits which is 16 in this case.
   * The program then requests the 4 digit pin of the customer which is validated for integer and number of digits which is 4 in this case.
   * After successful payment the program thanks the customer for the business and provides option to exit the program by pressing Enter.

* Fourth option on Order screen provides user a search feature which looks up Order value entered by user to see if it matches an previous order.
  * This order value entered by the user is searched in the whole sales sheet and then in column heading of ORDER_NUM.
  * If the value is not found the user is informed that the value entered is not an order value yet. And further directed to the order screen to complete order or enter the correct order value.
  * If the value is found then the corresponding order value details like customer name, item sold and price are displayed. And further directed to the order screen to complete order.

# Testing

## Manual Testing 
   
![Manual Testing](/assets/images/readmeimages/ManualTestImage.jpg "Manual Testing")

* PEP8 Testing:
  Since Pep8online is down, so installed So as a alternative option have installed a extension within VS Code to flag any errors.

   * Run the command pip3 install pycodestyle Note that this extension may already be installed, in which case this command will do nothing.
   * In your workspace, press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).
   * Type the word linter into the search bar that appears, and click on Python: Select Linter from the filtered results.
   * Select pycodestyle from the list.
   * PEP8 errors will now be underlined in red, as well as being listed in the PROBLEMS tab beside your terminal.

Any styling errors would show up as a warning or critical error.
In the image below I have highlighted a red rectangle around the results. Left to right you have critical errors, warnings and info. We do not have to worry about the info flags. 
  * There are 0 Critical errors and 3 warnings which are not related to coffeehousepos code.

![pccodesytlecheck](/assets/images/readmeimages/pycodestylecheck.jpg "pccodesytlecheck")

## Bugs

* During earlier stage in program the Order value search were producing wrong order details. This was due the user entered value was searched in the whole sales Google sheet. 
Hence if user entered username as order value or item name as value the search was producing errors.

![error order search](/assets/images/readmeimages/errordersearch.jpg "error order search")

* To fix this a list was created with all values of ORDER_NUM column. And from that list ORDER_NUM was removed as it was not real order value created but an heading in the sheet. User entered order value was ran through this list as well which fixed the issue.
* There are no other bugs detected.

## Known Bugs

![knownbug search](/assets/images/readmeimages/knownbug.jpg "knownbug search")

* Since order value search is going through two if statements sometime if the order value is not found we get 2 errors instead of one.
